# ARP-Poisoning-Lab
## üìñ Overview
This repository contains an ARP Poisoning Lab designed for educational purposes to demonstrate network vulnerabilities and teach mitigation techniques. The lab environment includes three virtual machines (Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux, and Windows 10) configured in a Host-Only network using VMware Workstation. The lab setup simulates an ARP poisoning attack to explore network security principles.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Custom ARP Poisoning Script: A Python script (arp_poisoning.py) leveraging Scapy for ARP spoofing, DoS attacks, and ARP table restoration.
- Isolated Virtual Network: Ensures all activities are confined within a private lab environment.
- Hands-On Learning: Demonstrates attack vectors, impact on victim devices, and countermeasures.
- Cross-Platform Testing: Works across Linux (Kali) and Windows (Victim) platforms.
  
## üîß Requirements
### Software
  - VMware Workstation or equivalent virtualization software.
  - Python 3.6+ installed on the attacker machine
  - Hardware
      Minimum 8GB RAM and 100GB disk space across all virtual machines.
#### On Kali Linux (Attacker):
  Scapy library for network packet manipulation:
  ```bash
  pip install scapy
  ```

## üöÄ How to Use
### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heaven229-c/ARP-Poisoning-Lab.git
cd ARP-Poisoning-Lab
```
### 2. Set Up the Lab: Follow the instructions in Setup ARP Poisoning Lab.md to configure the virtual machines and the network environment.

### 3. Run the Script:
**Start the Python script on the Kali Linux machine:**
```bash
python3 ARP_Poisoning.py
```
Choose the desired operation from the menu (e.g., scan network, ARP spoofing, DoS attack).

**4.Observe and Analyze:**
  - Use Wireshark or similar tools to analyze the traffic.
  - Monitor the victim‚Äôs device for connectivity issues or altered ARP tables.

**5.Restore Network:**
Ensure ARP tables are restored after testing by selecting the appropriate option in the script.

## üîÆ Future Development
Mitigation Tutorials: Add guides for configuring ARP table static entries or using tools like arpwatch.
Automated Reporting: Implement a feature to generate detailed logs and reports of ARP attacks.
Expanded Lab Scenarios: Include additional attack simulations (e.g., DNS spoofing, MITM attacks).
Dockerized Lab Environment: Provide a pre-configured, containerized lab setup for ease of deployment.
